# CSH Project Management System

A system for CSH to manage, track, and document house projects.

## Get Started
1. Go to [pms.csh.rit.edu](https://pms.csh.rit.edu/) and sign in to your CSH account.
2. Create a profile with a bio, picture, and links to your websites.
3. Add a new project with links, pictures, and descirption.
4. View other projects made by CSHers.

## A note on pictures
All pictures are resized to 300 px wide, then cropped to 100 px tall. For best results, upload a 300x100 px image.

*If you have a suggestion on a better way to handle this, submit a pull request*

## Future Improvements
* More links to external websites related to project (GitHub, Wiki, etc).
* Integrated build-log and/or documentation system.
* Include skills on profiles.
* Search for members with specific skills, or projects that need a certain skill.
* Custom lists or tags such as 'eboard picks' or 'freshmen projects'.
