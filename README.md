# CSH Project Management System

A system for CSH to manage, track, and document house projects. In addition, the system will serve as a way to recruit members onto projects based on skillset and interests.

## My Ideas
* Links to external websites related to project (GitHub, Wiki, etc).
* Integrated build-log and/or documentation system.
* Profile of skills and projects.
* Search for members with specific skills, or projects that need a certain skill.
* Lists or tags such as 'eboard picks' or 'freshmen projects'

## Navigation Breakdown
* Index - List of all active projects and concepts
* Project details - Link to external sites, and author profile.
